    title: 'Identification and Characterization of a Long-distance, Mobile Signal of Induced Systemic Resistance (ISR)',
    description: 'Developed ISR assays in Arabidopsis thaliana using bacterial leaf infiltration assay with Pseudomonas syringae. Isolated ISR-inducible and non-inducible Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria in A. thaliana and probed ISR development in OPDA, JA, and SA biogenesis and/or signaling mutant using Reverse Genetics. Performed transcription analysis to see the hormone biosynthesis/signaling marker gene induction and hormone analysis for defense hormone presence in root, stem, and leaves.'

    title: 'Elucidating the Enzymatic Activity and Gene Expression of IST (against drought) Genes - RD29A and RD29B',
    description: 'Prepared recombinant RD29A and RD29B proteins by expressing them in E. coli BL21:PET28A expression system. Performed an enzymatic assay and looked at the kinetics of RD29A and RD29B proteins. Observed time-course expression and compensatory effect of these in various abiotic stresses and characterized them as circadian rhythm genes.'
