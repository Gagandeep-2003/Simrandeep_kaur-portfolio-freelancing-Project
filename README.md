## Overview
This portfolio highlights research and projects in plant pathology, including induced systemic resistance (ISR), drought resistance genes, plant defense against nematodes, genetic mutations, and wheat safety improvements. Built with React, it uses modern libraries like `framer-motion` for animations and `react-lenis` for smooth scrolling.

## Features
- **Loading Animation**: A microscope-themed preloader with dynamic plant cell animations.
- **Hero Section**: Animated "PLANT PATHOLOGIST" headings with a leaf image, fully responsive.
- **About Section**: Tiltable cards showcasing key aspects of plant science, enlarged for mobile visibility.
- **Projects Section**: Hoverable cards with titles and subtitles that slide in from the top-right, with increased sizes and spacing on mobile.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Powered by `react-lenis` for a seamless user experience.
